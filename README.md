# Round-Robin-Algorithm
# Round Robin Algorithm in C++ only for TurboC and TurboC++
P.S: This Project will run only on TurboC and TurboC++ because of some <dos.h> header file fuctions included in the code which are not supported by the new compilers.

Steps for running the program:

Step 1: Download the code from the GitHub Repository.

Step 2: After you unzip the file, create a folder named OS_PROJ at the location C:\TURBOC3\BIN.

Step 3: Paste all the four file (BEG.H, OS_FIN.CPP, OUTLINE.H, WELCOME.H)which you have extracted by unziping the file into the newly created OS_PROJ folder.

Step 4: Now, run the OS_FIN.CPP in your TurboC or TurboC++ software.

(IF YOU WANT TO SKIP STEP-2, STEP-3 AND WANT TO SAVE THE FOLDER AT DIFFERENT LOCATION, YOU WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE THE PATH OF THE HEADER FILES INCLUDED IN THE BEG.H AND OS_FIN.CPP 
FILES, AND REPLACE THE PATH WITH THE LOCATION AT WHICH YOU HAVE STORED THE FOLDER.)
